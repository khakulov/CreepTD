„CreepTD is an online multiplayer towerdefense game for 2-4 players playing on one map. It's the mother of all TD games.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**It's simple: At the beginning, every player gets 20 lives to defend. The goal of the game is, of course, to survive your opponents.**

To do so, you need to build and later upgrade different kinds of towers to defend your lives agains incoming creeps. If you don't and a creep passes through your board completely, you lose a life. On the other hand you have to send different kinds of creeps to your opponents, so that they will lose their lifes. Additionally, when sending creeps, your income per round (one round lasts 15 seconds) raises. The more money you have, the more advanced towers can be built and the more advanced creeps are available to send. Sounds simple, but believe me, it's all about the right strategy somewhere between defending and attacking to win the game! And of course, there is a lot of detail in placing towers at the right locations and selecting the best fitting tower attack strategy.

Are you smart enough?
